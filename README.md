# Fast Planar Linkage Mechanism Solver And Automatic Differentiation For Gradient-Based Optimization and Path Synthsis
Code for 18337 project by Amin Heyrani Nobari

The code consists of two jupyter notebooks one is called the CPU Experiments.ipynb which is the Julia code for the experiments and gradient based optimizaiton and the other is GPU Experiments.ipynb which is a python code to test the GPU solver using pytorch.

For the python environemnt the following modules are needed:

pytorch
tqdm
numpy
